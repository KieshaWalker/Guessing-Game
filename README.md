# Guessing Game

## Overview
**Number Guessing Game** is a simple browser-based game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. With only 10 attempts, the player receives feedback after each guess—either "Too high," "Too low," or "You guessed it!"—until they win or run out of guesses.

I chose this game because it’s a great way to practice core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, DOM manipulation, and user feedback. It’s also a fun challenge to architect clean logic and UI flow in a beginner-friendly format.
